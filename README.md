## Project Overview

Millions of people globally and over 3 million in Egypt alone suffer from visual impairment. This system addresses their mobility and independence by combining Raspberry Pi-powered smart glasses with object detection, face recognition, currency recognition, and OCR capabilities.

The system offers real-time **audio feedback** based on the userâ€™s visual surroundings and features a mobile app for remote assistance and text reading.

## ðŸ§  System Features

### Face Recognition
- Recognizes familiar individuals using Dlibâ€™s 128D face embeddings.
- Trained using a custom dataset for the 5 memebers of the Graduation project group.

### Object Detection
- Utilizes YOLOv5 trained on COCO 2017 dataset (80 classes).
- Real-time detection and spatial awareness (person, car, chair, etc.).
- Operates on Raspberry Pi 5 with a compressed NCNN model.

###  Currency Recognition
- Custom YOLOv11 model trained on Egyptian pound banknotes.
- Accurate denomination detection (e.g., 10, 50, 100 EGP).


### OCR (Text Detection)
- Glasses: EasyOCR supports Arabic and English.
- Mobile App: Google ML Kit performs OCR offline.
- Useful for reading labels, signs, medicine boxes, and receipts.

## Mobile App (Flutter)

- Built using Flutter for Android.
- Features:
  - Real-time OCR via camera.
  - Chat interface for reaching out to volunteers.
  - Text-to-speech and speech-to-text for full voice control.
- Clean, accessible UI for visually impaired users.
